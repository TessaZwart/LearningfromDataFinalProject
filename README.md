## Explanation of repository

Classification of offensive tweets by using a classic model, LSTM, and language model. Additionally, we investigated if data augmentation using English-Spanish back translation, can improve the language model. Our research paper can be found here:

(2019)


### 0. Using classic model

### 1. Using Enhanced classic model

### 2. Using LSTM model
To use the LSTM model, you can use the following command:
```
python3 LSTM.py
```
The model makes use of the following hyperparameters:
ADD BEST HYPERPARAMETERS

### 3. Using Language model



Glove for LSTM:
!wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
!unzip glove*.zip

## Chapter 3: How to train the model on own unseen data set
Different data can be used by changing the input data, using --train_file <OWN_TRAIN_FILE>, --dev_file <OWN_DEV_FILE>, or --test_file <OWN_TEST_FILE>, after the comment line. For example, running the LSTM model:
```
python3 LSTM.py --train_file <OWN_TRAIN_FILE> --dev_file <OWN_DEV_FILE> --test_file <OWN_TEST_FILE>
```
